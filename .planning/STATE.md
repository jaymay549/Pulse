# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-13)

**Core value:** Vendors authenticate via Supabase magic link and see only the data their tier permits — separate from dealer auth, managed by the sales team
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Vendor Auth Primitives

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Vendor Auth Primitives)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Supabase Auth (not Clerk) for vendors — separate identity system, magic link is simpler for managed credentials
- Magic link only (no password) — sales team creates credentials; vendors click a link
- Dedicated vendor Supabase client with isolated `storageKey: 'vendor-auth'` is mandatory to prevent session bleed into Clerk admin context

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 pre-req: SECURITY DEFINER RPC audit must enumerate all vendor dashboard RPCs before any RLS policy ships (142 SECURITY DEFINER functions in codebase, many accept `vendor_name TEXT` with no tier check)
- Phase 3 pre-req: Validate `vendor_name` string matching across `vendor_logins`, `vendor_profiles`, and `vendor_mentions` before writing RLS policies — silent empty datasets if casing mismatches
